This is a plugin that allows you to upload code (only saved .ino files) to arduino
It uses the Arduino-CLI 4 (only) in order to do so, and you got to have the cli on your PATH.

It is based on the C# template found here: 
https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net/releases/

I only tested it on a 64bit 7.7.1 version of the Npp
And only tested it on a uno and a mega so far. 
I did try on WEMOS LION 32 and it faile - planning to look into it soon.
